  <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong>10 minutes</p>
  <p><strong>Serves:</strong>4</p>
    <h4>Step 1: Prepare the Pickles</h4>
<ol><li>Drain the pickle spears and pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the batter stick better.</li></ol>
<h4>Step 2: Set Up a Breading Station</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bowl 1 (Flour Mixture): Combine the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and black pepper. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Bowl 2 (Egg Wash): Whisk together the eggs and milk until smooth.</li>
    <li>Bowl 3 (Breadcrumbs): Place breadcrumbs in a seperate bowl.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 3: Bread the Pickles</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a pickle spear and coat it thoroughly in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dip it into the egg wash, ensuring it’s fully coated.</li>
        <li>Roll the pickle in the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
        <li>Place the breaded pickle on a plate and repeat with the remaining spears.</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Step 4: Heat the Oil</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour vegetable oil into a deep skillet or heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of about 2 inches.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Use a kitchen thermometer to maintain the temperature.</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Step 5: Fry the Picles</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Carefully place a few breaded pickle spears into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pot.</li>
        <li>Fry for 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the pickles with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining spears.</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the crispy pickle spears on a serving platter.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce like ranch dressing, spicy aioli, or honey mustard.</li>
    </ol>
